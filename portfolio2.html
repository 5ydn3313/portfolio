<h2> My plans for this portfoilo:</h2>
<h3> I plan to include all of my past projects including my projects on sprite. Right now none of them are very impressive but this portfolio is just a record of my improvement and by the end of this project I'm sure my projects will be very impressive and interesting. </h3>

<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> I am a rising junior in high school. I joined Girls Who Code to make new friends, do something new and step outside of my comfort zone.</p>
<p> I play two instruments; tenor saxophone and clarinet.</p>
<p>  I love reading, watching movies and doing new things </p>
<p> I also love long walks on the beach ;) This is a joke.</h>
